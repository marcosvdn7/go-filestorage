Go File Storage it's a tutorial project I'm doing, following a 10 hours tutorial on how to implement
a distributed file storage using golang. In the tutorial, the author briefly goes through concepts like
peer to peer architecture, TCP protocol and storage file management, while effectively implementing a
system using the aforementioned topics.
